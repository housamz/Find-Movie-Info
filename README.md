# Find Complete Movie Info
This tool finds all important info about a movie from three sources, IMDB, Meta Critic, and Rotten Tomatoes, and generate a JSON object with the data.

The interface uses Python Flask, and the data fetching depends on Python 2.7 libraries; these libraries need to be installed in order for the code to work.

Please install the libraries as follows:  
`pip install flask`  
`pip install requests`  
`pip install bs4`  
`pip install lxml`
